# GPU Resource RL Scheduler

## Objective

Design and deploy a reinforcement learning-based GPU resource scheduler that optimizes performance-per-watt under memory and thermal constraints.

## Scope (Phase 1)

- Single GPU simulation
- Memory constraints
- Power consumption modeling
- Thermal modeling
- FIFO baseline scheduler
- RL training (PPO planned)

## Planned Architecture

1. Simulator (Gym-style environment)
2. Baseline policies
3. RL training
4. MLOps integration
5. API serving
6. Interactive dashboard
